# The-3-Brothers

The game is a 2D arcade-type. There are 2 basic characters in the game, which a player can control them both. Each one of them is controlled by different inputs and have different tasks. The blue character gathers gems and the gray one shoots some projectiles for the enemies.

The blue character needs to gather resources in a very limited time. Time is displayed above the blue character and each time gathers a gem, time is extended by a little bit. When blue character gathers gems, then projectiles are provided to Gray character.

Gray character, has the ability to fire some projectiles for killing the enemies. The character also has a very limited time to kill the enemies, and when an enemy is killed, time is extended by a little bit too. If gray character is out of bullets and did not exterminate all the enemies, while blue character collected all resources then the level is lost and player will be forced to restart the level.

Enemies are spiders inside the scene, which some of them move and some of them not. They move around the scene to make the game more difficult. For example, gray player may miss by firing at them. Or if any of the characters touch a spider, level is lost again.

The goal is, actually to save the yellow character which is non controllable by the player and then exit the level. When all enemies are killed, yellow character moves to the exit, as well as player must control both characters to get them to the exit too. Only then, the level is completed!

There are 3 levels, which first one is a little bit easy and as they go on, they get more difficult.
The core mechanics of the game are the “Timed Tasks” and “Squad”. The combination of these two not only gives a novel experience to the player, but mostly makes the game extremely competitive and challenging, thus assuring the player to never get bored.

• The 1st mechanic is that in the game, some tasks must be completed in a specific given time. That of course, does not mean that the task should concern by only completing the level.

• 2nd mechanic is that player can control more than one character in the game.

These 2 specific mechanics give an excellent combination, since they can cooperate perfectly and create a synergy among them. The synergy in this game is actually that a task cannot be completed, if another task has not been completed first.
